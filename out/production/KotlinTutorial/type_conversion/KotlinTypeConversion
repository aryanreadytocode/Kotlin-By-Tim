As we know Java supports implicit type conversion from smaller to larger data types. An
integer value can be assined to the long data type.

But, Kotlin does not support implicit type conversion. An integer can not be assigned to the long
data type.

var number = 100;
var myLongNumber: Long = number     // compile error, Type mismatch: inferred type is Int but Long was expected.


var myNumber = 100
var myLongNumber: Long = myNumber.toLong()

The following helper function can be used to convert one data type into another:

    -- toByte()
    -- toShort()
    -- toInt()
    -- toLong()
    -- toFloat()
    -- toDouble()
    -- toChar()

    Note: There is no helper function available to convert into boolean type.
